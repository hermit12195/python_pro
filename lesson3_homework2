     Methods:
     _______

     __add__(other)
         Perform adding with objects.
     __sub__(other)
         Perform subtracting with objects.
     __mul__(other)
         Perform multiplying with objects.
     __lt__(other)
         Compare if an object is smaller than another one.
     __eq__()
         Compare if objects are equal.
     vector_length(other)
        Find the vector length.
